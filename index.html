      My Name is Pete Jeffryes. I am student of the Full Stack Program at
      Galvanive in Denver, CO. This blog will be a bulletin board for
      lessons and concepts that I encounter throughout this 6 month intensive
      program and will be updated M-F.

        Here is the first post. In should be a great post about what I learned today.
        Hopefully people will read it who are interested in programming and
        can use the information to help them acheive their own goals. At the
        very least it will help me solidify each day's lessons and show me how
        far I have come in such a short time.
