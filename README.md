##What I Learned Today


The purpose of this blog is three fold:

1. Practice basic web dev skills in HTML, CSS and javascript
2. Log what I have learned daily at the Galvanize Full Stack Program
3. Provide a resource for aspiring programmers like myself

I will do my best to update this blog Monday through Friday with the main "take-aways" of the day. I expect the posts to range from conceptual to hard code examples to references to excellent sources of info.

Eventually, (hopefully sooner than later) there will be a back end with an through which I will add posts.
